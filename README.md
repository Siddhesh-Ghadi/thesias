**THESIAS** (**Testing Haplotype EffectS In Association Studies**) is a popular software for carrying haplotype association analysis in unrelated individuals.
In addition to the command line interface, a graphical JAVA interface is now proposed allowing one to run THESIAS in a user-friendly manner.
Besides, new functionalities have been added to THESIAS including the possibility to analyze polychotomous phenotype and X-linked polymorphisms.
